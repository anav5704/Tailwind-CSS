![hero](https://anav5704/Tailwinnd-CSS/blob/main/docs/kants-tailwind.png)

This is a simple car rental website. There is not much on the website itself as this was my first go at TailwinndCSS. It is absolutely amazing and web development wouln't be nearly as fun as it is without it. Using it for the first time was very uncomfortable but once you get used to it, you can't go back.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- TailwinndCSS

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the live ```server extension``` installed in VS Code. Then fork and clone the repo. Once cloned, just fire up the live server and enjoy.
