![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/Tailwind-CSS/blob/main/docs/kants-tailwind.png)

This is a simple car rental website. There is not much on the website itself as this was my first go at TailwinndCSS. It is absolutely amazing and web development wouldn't be nearly as fun as it is without it. Using it for the first time was very uncomfortable but once you get used to it, you can't go back.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- TailwinndCSS

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. First run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Once that is done, run ```npm start``` to view it on localhost.
